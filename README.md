# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview:

Purpose of the Analysis: Define of how to address any disparities in the ride-sharing data among the city types.


## Results:

**TOTAL FARE BY CITY TYPE**

The fares are higher in Urban cities, compared to Suburban, and Rural, where the rates are lower.

## Summary:

The Rural areas have the lowest amount of Rides and Drivers, therefore the Total Fares are lower. The Average Fare per Ride and per Driver is more expensive. 

The Suburban areas are right in between Rural areas and Urban areas, because the Total Rides, and Total Drivers are also in between both city types.

The Urban areas have the highest amount of Rides and Drivers, therefore the Total Fares are higher, however the Average Fare per Ride, and the Average Fare per Driver are the lowest.

An assumption that can be done is that the demand is much higher in Urban areas, but the supply is high so the rates become lower, but the supply and demand might be lower in Rural areas, so the rates become higher. 

A recommendation that can be done is to perform a market research to understand if the demand is existent in Rural areas, and possibly expand the supply so the rates can be lower.
